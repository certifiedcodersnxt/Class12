## Coulomb's law (force between two point charges)

📚 Topic: Force between two point charges

📐 Formula: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \)

🎯 Use: Magnitude of electrostatic force between two point charges in vacuum.

📊 Values:
   - F = Force between charges (N)
   - k = Coulomb's constant = 9 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²
   - q₁, q₂ = Magnitudes of charges (C)
   - r = Distance between charges (m)
   - ε₀ = Permittivity of free space = 8.854 × 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²

💡 Notes: Force is attractive for unlike charges, repulsive for like charges. Acts along the line joining the charges. Vector form: **F** = k(q₁q₂/r²)**r̂** where **r̂** is unit vector from one charge toward the other. Valid for point charges in vacuum; for medium replace ε₀ by ε = ε₀εᵣ.
