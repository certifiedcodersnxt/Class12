## 10.1 Huygens' Principle

---

📚 **Topic: Huygens' Principle**

📐 **Formula (Concept):** 
```
Every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets.
The new wavefront is the forward envelope of all secondary wavelets.
```

🎯 **Use:** Explains the propagation of wavefronts and phenomena like reflection, refraction, and diffraction.

📊 **Values:**
- Wavefront = Locus of all points in same phase
- Plane wavefront: From a distant source
- Spherical wavefront: From a point source
- Cylindrical wavefront: From a linear source

💡 **Notes:** 
- Secondary wavelets spread out in all directions with speed of light in that medium
- Only forward envelope is considered (backward wavefront is ignored)
- Foundation for wave theory of light

---

📚 **Topic: Refraction Using Huygens' Principle**

📐 **Formula:** 
```
sin i / sin r = v₁/v₂ = λ₁/λ₂ = n₂/n₁
```

🎯 **Use:** Derives Snell's law using wave theory.

📊 **Values:**
- i = Angle of incidence
- r = Angle of refraction
- v₁, v₂ = Speed of light in medium 1 and 2
- λ₁, λ₂ = Wavelength in medium 1 and 2
- n₁, n₂ = Refractive indices

💡 **Notes:** 
- Frequency remains unchanged during refraction
- Wavelength changes: λ₂ = λ₁/n (in denser medium)
- Light slows down in denser medium

🔑 **Derivation Hint:** Consider a plane wavefront hitting a surface. Use the time taken for the wavefront to travel in both media. BC/v₁ = AE/v₂, then use geometry.

---

📚 **Topic: Intensity Ratio and Amplitude Ratio**

📐 **Formula:** 
```
Iₘₐₓ/Iₘᵢₙ = (a₁ + a₂)²/(a₁ - a₂)² = (√I₁ + √I₂)²/(√I₁ - √I₂)²

OR

(√Iₘₐₓ + √Iₘᵢₙ)/(√Iₘₐₓ - √Iₘᵢₙ) = a₁/a₂ (if a₁ > a₂)

🎯 **Use:** Determines the angle of incidence at which reflected light is completely polarized.

📊 **Values:**
- iB = Brewster's angle (polarizing angle)
- n = Refractive index of reflecting medium
- r = Angle of refraction

💡 **Notes:** 
- At Brewster's angle, reflected ray is perpendicular to refracted ray

- For glass (n ≈ 1.5): iB ≈ 57°

🔑 **Derivation Hint:** At polarizing angle, reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular. Use iB + r = 90° in Snell's law: n = sin iB/sin r = sin iB/sin(90° - iB) = sin iB/cos iB = tan iB.

---

📚 **Topic: Relation Between Brewster's Angle and Critical Angle**

📐 **Formula:** 
```
tan iB = n and sin iC = 1/n

Therefore: tan iB = 1/sin iC

```

🎯 **Use:** Relates polarizing angle and critical angle for a medium.

📊 **Values:**
- iB = Brewster's angle
- iC = Critical angle

```
Microscope: R.P. = 2n sin θ/λ

Telescope: R.P. = a/(1.22λ)

Diffraction Grating: R.P. = nN (n = order, N = total lines)
```

🎯 **Use:** Compares resolving abilities of different instruments.

💡 **Notes:** 
- Higher R.P. = Better ability to distinguish close objects/wavelengths
- Limited by diffraction
- Use shorter λ for better resolution
